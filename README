This plugin contains an Amazon S3 stream wrapper. That means you can
fopen(), file_put_contents(), opendir(), readdir(), closedir() etc. over
Amazon S3.

Unlike most wrappers there is full support for subdirectories (not just directory 
listings of entire buckets).

Be aware that files are buffered entirely in memory which will lead to
out of memory errors on files larger than your PHP memory limit. We're
working on buffering on the local drive instead as an option.

Although we are packaging it as a Symfony plugin for convenience it has no 
dependencies on Symfony or Apostrophe. See lib/wrapper/aS3StreamWrapperTest.php 
for extensive examples of proper usage.
